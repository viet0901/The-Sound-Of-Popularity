## ðŸ“œ Description

This project explores the relationship between musical features and the popularity of songs on Spotify. Using statistical modeling and data visualization, we identify the most influential traits of a songâ€™s success and build predictive models using Spotifyâ€™s 2023 dataset.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

To analyze Spotify's 2023 music data and determine which musical attributesâ€”such as danceability, energy, and tempoâ€”correlate most with a song's popularity, and to predict future hit potential using regression-based models.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

**Source:** Spotify 2023 Dataset (`spotify-2023.csv`)
**Key Features Analyzed:**

* **Danceability:** How suitable a track is for dancing
* **Energy:** Intensity and activity of a track
* **Loudness:** Average volume level
* **Speechiness:** Presence of spoken words
* **Tempo:** Beats per minute
* **Streams:** Number of plays (target variable)

---

## ðŸ›  Methodology

**Tools & Libraries:**

* `R`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `car`, `lmtest`, `leaps`

**Process:**

* **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, outliers, and formatting issues
* **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Correlation plots and visual trends
* **Regression Modeling:** Built multiple linear regression models
* **Best Subset Selection:** Used AIC and adjusted RÂ² to select top predictors

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Results and Insights

* **Danceability** and **Energy** are the strongest predictors of stream counts
* **Speechiness** is negatively associated with popularity
* The final regression model explains a meaningful portion of variance in song streams
* Visual outputs and plots are available in the notebook and presentation files
